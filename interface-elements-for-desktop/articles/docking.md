In the **Docking** section, you will learn about the main runtime capabilities of the DocumentManager and DockManager, which can be combined to create traditional docking UI applications (see the image below).

The main elements of the DocumentManager and DockManager components are Documents and Dock panels, respectively. These objects are containers that display content and provide docking functionality â€“ you can drag Documents and Dock Panels into a tab group, dock them to different application dock zones, make them floating or auto-hidden, etc.

This section consists of the following topics.
* [Dock Panels](docking/dock-panels.md)
