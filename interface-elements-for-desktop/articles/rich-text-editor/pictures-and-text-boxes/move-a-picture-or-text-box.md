# Move a Picture or Text Box
## Move a Picture or Text Box
1. Select the [floating picture](insert-a-picture.md) or [text box](insert-select-copy-or-delete-a-text-box.md) that you wish to move.
2. Drag the object to the new location.

## Move a Picture or Text Box Forward or Backward
When you add floating objects into a document, they are automatically inserted in particular layers. Objects can overlap. In this case the top object covers lower objects (in full or in part). You can move particular objects up and down in a stack one layer at a time, or move them to the top or bottom of a stack in one click.
1. Select the [floating picture](insert-a-picture.md) or [text box](insert-select-copy-or-delete-a-text-box.md) that you wish to move up or down in the stack.
2. Select the required item from the floating object's context menu ...
