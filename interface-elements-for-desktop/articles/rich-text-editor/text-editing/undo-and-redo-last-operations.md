# Undo and Redo Last Operations
The **Rich Editor** allows you to undo and redo the last operation using the special buttons (**Undo** and **Redo**) on the **File** [tab](../text-editor-ui/ribbon-interface.md).

The **Undo** command reverses the most recent action you have performed. To undo an action, on the **File** tab, in the **Common** group, click the **Undo** button, or press **CTRL+Z**, or press **ALT+BACKSPACE**.

You can execute multiple **Undo** operations. To return the document to its previous state, just keep performing **Undo**.

The **Redo** command enables you to take back the last action you've undone. To redo an action, click the **Redo** button, or press **CTRL+Y**, or press **ALT+SHIFT+BACKSPACE**.
