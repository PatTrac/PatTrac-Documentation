To select text in the **Rich Editor**, use the following mouse actions and keyboard shortcuts.
* Selecting **one character**
	
	To select only one character, click before the character, hold down the **Shift** key and click the **Right Arrow** once.
* Selecting **one word**
	
	To select one word in a document, place the cursor anywhere in the word (or just before it) and **double-click** with the left mouse button. Another method is to place your cursor at the beginning of the word, hold down the **Shift** and **Ctrl** keys, and click the **Right Arrow**.
* Selecting **one paragraph**
	
	Selecting one paragraph is similar to selecting one word. Place the cursor in the paragraph and click **three times** with the left mouse button. Another method is to place the cursor in the left margin and **click twice** to highlight the whole paragraph.
* Selecting **entire document**
	
	Click **three times** on the left side of the page in the margin area, and the entire document will be highlighted.  Also, the **CTRL+A** keyboard shortcut can be used to highlight the entire document.
* Selecting **one line**
	
	The cursor in the margin will highlight one line with one click. Another method is to place the cursor at the beginning of the line, and use the **SHIFT+END** keyboard shortcut to extend selection to the end of the line. Similarly, at the end of the line the **SHIFT+HOME** keyboard shortcut can be used.
