# Insert Page Numbers into Printed Documents
To insert or remove page numbers from a document, first [invoke the Header and Footer dialog](insert-page-header-and-page-footer-into-printed-documents.md).

Focus a text box, depending on the required alignment, and do one of the following:
* If you need to simply display the current page number, click the **Page Number** ![previewButtonPageNumber](../../../../images/img7270.png) button.
* If you need to display the page number out of the total number of pages, click the **Page # of Pages #** ![previewButtonPageOf](../../../../images/img7271.png) button.

When you click one of these buttons, the dialog adds an alias within square brackets at the current cursor position. You can surround this alias with any text you like. If you no longer need page numbers in your document, delete this alias.

Click OK to save changes and close the dialog.
