# Print a Document Using Default Settings
To send a document directly to the default printer without customizing print settings, do one of the following.
* Click the **Quick Print** ![previewButtonQuickPrint](../../../../images/img7262.png) button on the toolbar.
* On the **File** menu, click **Print**.

To learn how to select a printer, number of copies, and other printing options, refer to the [Print a Document via the Print Dialog](print-a-document-via-the-print-dialog.md) topic.

 
> [!NOTE]
> If you try to print a document whose margins are outside of the printable area, you'll see a [warning message](../warnings-and-error-messages-in-print-preview.md). Click **Yes** to print the document anyway, if you're sure that your printer supports the specified page margins.
