# Change Printing Settings via the Page Setup Dialog
To start the page setup dialog box, do one of the following.
* Click the **Page Setup** ![previewButtonPageSetup](../../../../images/img7266.png) button on the toolbar.
* On the **File** menu, click **Page Setup...**

The following dialog will be invoked.

![PageSetupDialog](../../../../images/img7297.png)

This dialog allows you to do the following:
* Change page orientation (choose Portrait or Landscape).
* Select paper size.
* Change page margins. (This can also be done [in the Print Preview dialog](specify-page-margins-in-print-preview.md))

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working with a document that was [loaded from file](../file-management/load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md), the **Page Setup** commands on the toolbar and main menu will be disabled.
