# Specify Page Margins in Print Preview
To set document page margins, do one of the following.
* **Use the Page Setup dialog**
	
	In the [Page Setup dialog](change-printing-settings-via-the-page-setup-dialog.md), enter the required top, left, bottom and right page margins' values into the appropriate editors.

	Then, click OK to save changes.
* **Use drag-and-drop in the Print Preview window**
	
	To use this approach, point to the dotted line indicating the margin's border. When the pointer changes to ![cursorMargin](../../../../images/img7305.gif), drag the pointer to move the margin.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working with a document that was [loaded from file](../file-management/load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md), it is impossible to change its page settings (e.g. page size, orientation, margins, etc.).
