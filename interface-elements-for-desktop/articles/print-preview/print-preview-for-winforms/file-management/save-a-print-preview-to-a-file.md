# Save a Print Preview to a File
If you've modified your document, and there's a chance you'll need to print out this document version more than once, you can save the document to a file on disk. After that, you can simply load your document and print it out, without having to apply the same changes again.

To save a document to the file, click the **Save** ![previewButtonSave](../../../../images/img7259.png) button on the toolbar, or press CTRL+S.

On the invoked **Save As** dialog, locate a folder where you want to store your file, enter the document's name and click **Save**.

![SaveAsDialog](../../../../images/img7376.png)

Your document will be saved with the **.prnx** file extension. Note that this extension will be added to the file name even if you enter another one.

> [!NOTE]
> If you [open a document](load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md) which was previously saved to the hard drive, it is impossible to change its page settings (e.g. page size, orientation, margins, etc.). So, the **Page Setup** and the **Scale** buttons will be disabled.
