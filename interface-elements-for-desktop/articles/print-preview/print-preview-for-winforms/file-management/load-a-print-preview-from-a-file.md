# Load a Print Preview from a File

On the invoked **Open** dialog, define the file and click **Open**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you open a document  previously saved to the hard drive, it is impossible to change its page settings (e.g. page size, orientation, margins, etc.). So, the **Page Setup** and **Scale** buttons will be disabled.
