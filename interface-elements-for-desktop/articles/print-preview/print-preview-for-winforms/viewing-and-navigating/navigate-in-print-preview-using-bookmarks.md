# Navigate in Print Preview Using Bookmarks
If a document contains bookmarks, you can use the **Document Map** panel for navigation purposes.

To toggle this panel's visibility, use the **Docuemnt Map** ![previewButtonDocumentMap](../../../../images/img7434.png) button on the toolbar. To go to a specific bookmark, click it in the Document Map. As a result, the Print Preview navigates to a document element associated with the bookmark.
