# Use the Hand Tool in Print Preview
The **Hand Tool** enables you to scroll content by dragging the document instead of using scrollbars.

To activate the **Hand Tool**, click the **Hand Tool** ![previewButtonHand](../../../../images/img7263.png) button on the toolbar.

Then, after you click a document's page, the mouse pointer is changed from ![ZoomingChart5](../../../../images/img7227.gif) to ![ZoomingChart6](../../../../images/img7228.jpeg). Drag the mouse pointer to scroll the document.
