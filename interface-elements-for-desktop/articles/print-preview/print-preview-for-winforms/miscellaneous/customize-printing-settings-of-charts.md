# Customize Printing Settings of Charts
If allowed by your application vendor, you can customize additional print settings of a document. For example, if you are about to print out a chart, you may be able to customize the chart's printing options.

To do this, click the **Customize** ![previewButtonCustomize](../../../../images/img7442.png) button on the toolbar. The **Print Options** dialog will be invoked.

* **None**
	
	A chart is printed in the same size identical to that shown on the form.
* **Stretch**
	
	A chart is stretched or shrunk to fit the page on which it is printed.
* **Zoom**
	
	A chart is resized proportionally (without clipping), so that it best fits the page on which it is printed.
