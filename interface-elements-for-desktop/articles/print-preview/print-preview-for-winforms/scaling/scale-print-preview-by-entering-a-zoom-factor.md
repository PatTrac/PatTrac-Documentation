# Scale Print Preview by Entering a Zoom Factor
To scale a document, click the **Scale** ![previewButtonScale](../../../../images/img7267.png) button on the toolbar. The **Scaling** dialog will be invoked.

Set the required percentage value in the editor.

![previewPercentage](../../../../images/img7275.png)

Click **OK** to save changes and close the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working with a document [loaded from file](../file-management/load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md), you cannot use scaling.
