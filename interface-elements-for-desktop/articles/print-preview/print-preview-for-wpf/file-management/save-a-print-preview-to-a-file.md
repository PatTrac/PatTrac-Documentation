# Save a Print Preview to a File
If you've modified your document, and there's a chance you'll need to print out this document version more than once, you can save the document to a file on disk. After that, you can simply load your document and print it out, without having to apply the same changes again.

To save a document to the file, do one of the following.
* Click the **Save** ![WPFDesigner_PreviewToolbar_Save](../../../../images/img120173.png) button on the toolbar.
* On the menu, click **Save**.
	
	![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_MenuSave](../../../../images/img124018.png)
* Press CTRL+S.

In the invoked **Save As** dialog, locate a folder where you want to store your file, enter the document name and click **Save**.

![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_SaveAsDialog](../../../../images/img124019.png)

The document is saved with the **.prnx** file extension. Note that this extension will be added to the file name even if you enter another one.

> [!NOTE]
> If you [open a document](load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md) that was previously saved to the hard drive, it is impossible to change its page settings (e.g., page size, orientation, margins, etc.). So, the **Page Setup** and the **Scale** buttons will be disabled.
