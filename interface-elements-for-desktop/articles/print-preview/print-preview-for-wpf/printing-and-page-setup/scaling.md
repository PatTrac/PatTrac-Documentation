# Scaling
To scale a document, click the **Scale** ![WPFDesigner_PreviewToolbar_Scale](../../../../images/img120175.png) button on the Print Preview's toolbar. This invokes the **Scale** dialog.

![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_ScaleDialog](../../../../images/img124039.png)

The dialog provides two ways for scaling the document.
* **Scaling by entering a zoom factor**.
	
	Select the first option and set the required percentage value in the dedicated editor.
* **Scaling to fit into X pages**.
	
	Choose the second option and specify the required number of pages.

Click **OK** to save changes and close the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working with a document [loaded from a file](../file-management/load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md), you cannot use scaling.
