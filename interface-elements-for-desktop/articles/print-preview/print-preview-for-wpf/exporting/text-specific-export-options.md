# Text-Specific Export Options
When [exporting a document](exporting.md), you can define the following TXT-specific exporting options.

![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_TxtExportOptions](../../../../images/img124165.png)
* **Encoding**
	
	Specifies the encoding used in the exported document.
* **Text export mode**
	
	Specifies whether to use the formatting of data fields in the bound data source for cells in the exported document. If this option is set to **Text**, all data fields are exported to the text file as strings with the corresponding formatting embedded into those strings. If the option is set to **Value**, all formatting will be lost in the resulting document.
* **Text separator**
	
	Specifies a symbol to separate text elements (TAB by default).
* **Quote strings with separators**
	
	Specifies whether strings with separators should be placed in quotation marks in the exported document.
