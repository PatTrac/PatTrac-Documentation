# Navigate Using the Hand Tool
The **Hand Tool** enables you to scroll content by dragging the document instead of using scrollbars.

Then, after you click a document's page, the mouse pointer is changed from ![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_HandTool1](../../../../images/img124044.png) to ![EUD_WpfPrintPreview_HandTool2](../../../../images/img124045.png). Drag the mouse pointer to scroll the document.
