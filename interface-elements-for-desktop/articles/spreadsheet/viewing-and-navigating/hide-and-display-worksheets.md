# Hide and Display Worksheets
The **Spreadsheet** provides the capability to hide worksheets in a workbook. It can be useful if you want to remove a worksheet from the **Sheet tab** bar without deleting it. By default, all worksheets are displayed on the **Sheet tab** bar.

## Hide Worksheets
1. Switch to a worksheet you want to hide. To hide multiple worksheets, hold down **CTRL** and then click the sheet tabs of the worksheets you wish to hide on the **Sheet tab** bar.
2. Do one of the following:
	* On the **Home** tab, in the **Cells** group, click the **Format** button and select **Hide &amp; Unhide | Hide Sheet**. Note that this command is disabled when a workbook includes only one worksheet.
