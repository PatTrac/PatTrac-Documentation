# Insert a Comment
The **Spreadsheet** allows you to attach notes to individual cells by using **comments**. Comments are extremely useful when you need to provide additional information, such as reminders, notifications, or feedback in a document without modifying cell content.

Comments are displayed in a yellow box anchored to a cell. A cell containing a comment has a red triangular indicator in the corner.

You can [add](#addcomment) new comments, [edit](#editcomment) existing comments, [copy](#copycomment) comments to other cells, [move and resize](#movecomment) the comment box, [hide](#hidecomment) or [delete](#deletecomment) comments if they are no longer needed.
