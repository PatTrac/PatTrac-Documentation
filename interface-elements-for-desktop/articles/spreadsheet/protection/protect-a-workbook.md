# Protect a Workbook
Workbook protection prevents users from changing a workbookâ€™s structure (by moving, deleting, adding, hiding or displaying a hidden worksheet) or window position (by freezing or unfreezing panes).

You can protect a worksheet by using the following dialog:

![Protect_Workbook](../../../images/img23283.png)

To invoke this dialog, on the **Review** tab, in the **Changes** group, click **Protect Workbook**.

![SpreadsheetControl_Review_Changes](../../../images/img23281.png)

In a protected workbook, this button displays the "**Unprotect Workbook**" caption, which invokes a simple dialog that prompts for a password or unlocks the workbook if an empty password was set.
