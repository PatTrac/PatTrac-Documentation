3. To rotate a picture in 15-degree increments, drag the rotation handle while holding down the **SHIFT** key.

## Resize a Picture

2. Drag the _sizing handle_ away from the center (or towards the center) of the picture, and release it once the desired size is reached.

When you change the width of the object by dragging a _corner sizing handle_, the object's height will automatically be changed to maintain the aspect ratio of the object, and vice-versa.
