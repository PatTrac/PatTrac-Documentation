# Sort Data
The **Spreadsheet** provides the capability to sort data by text (**A to Z** or **Z to A**), numbers (**smallest to largest** or **largest to smallest**), dates and times (**oldest to newest** or **newest to oldest**) in one column.

To perform sorting, do the following.
1. Select a range in the column you wish to sort.
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> If multiple columns are selected, the range will be sorted by the **first** column.
2. On the **Data** tab, in the **Sort &amp; Filter** group, click **Sort A to Z** to select ascending order, or click **Sort Z to A** for descending order.

## Sort a Table
To sort data in a table, follow the steps below.
1. Click the arrow ![Spreadsheet_FilterAndSortArrow](../../../images/img25500.png) in the header of the column by which data will be sorted.
2. In the drop-down menu, select the **Sort A to Z** item to select ascending order, or select the **Sort Z to A** item to select descending order.

All the records in the table will be reordered accordingly. The tiny arrow ![Spreadsheet_SortedArrow](../../../images/img25503.png) appears in the column header to indicate that data in the table are sorted by this column.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot sort a table by more than one column at a time. When you apply a new sort order, it replaces the previous one.
