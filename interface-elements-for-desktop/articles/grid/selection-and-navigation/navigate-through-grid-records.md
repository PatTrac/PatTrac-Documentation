# Navigate Through Grid Records
## Move Focus Between Rows and Cards
To move focus between cells and rows use the ARROW, TAB, HOME, END, PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys. Note that the ARROW, HOME and END keys are used for navigation between rows/cards only when the focused cell is not being edited.

* In Grid Views, press LEFT ARROW. In Card Views and Layout Views, press UP ARROW.
	If a cell editor is active, pressing LEFT ARROW moves focus to the previous cell if the caret is positioned at the beginning of the current cell's text, or if the cell's text is selected in its entirety.
