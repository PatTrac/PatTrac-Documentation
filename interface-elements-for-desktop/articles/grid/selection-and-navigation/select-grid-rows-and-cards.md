* In Card and Layout Views, click the card's caption or any of its data cells.
* Select the row/card using the ARROW keys.

## Select Multiple Rows or Cards
To select a row/card while preserving the current selection, do one of the following:
* In Grid Views, click the row's indicator cell or any of its data cells, while holding the CTRL key down.
* In Card and Layout Views, click the card's caption or any of its data cells, while holding the CTRL key down.

To toggle the focused row's/card's selected state, do one of the following:
* Press CTRL+SPACE.
* Click the row/card while holding the CTRL key down.

To move focus between rows and cards while preserving the current selection, use CTRL+ARROW keyboard shortcut (supported by Grid and Card Views).

## Select a Range of Rows/Cards
To select all rows/cards, press CTRL+A (supported by Grid and Layout Views). Before pressing this shortcut, ensure that the focused cell is not being edited

To select a continuous range or rows/cards, you can do the following
* Use ARROW, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN keys while holding the SHIFT key down.
* To select all rows/cards between the currently focused row/card and another one, click the target row/card while holding the SHIFT key down.
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> If the SHIFT key is combined with CTRL, the previously selected rows/cards, if there are any, are not unselected. If you use the SHIFT key alone, the previously selected rows/cards are unselected.
* To select a continuous range of cards in Layout Views, drag with the mouse around cards that are to be selected (marquee selection).

## Copy Selected Records to the Clipboard
