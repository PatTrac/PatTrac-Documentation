# Rotate a Chart
If you are working with 3D charts, you can rotate a chart's diagram. This may be required if a chart displays multiple series or data points, and it's required to change the current rotation angle to view the chart data in detail.

To rotate a chart control, do one of the following:
* **Hold down the left mouse button on the diagram and drag the mouse pointer.**
	
	After holding down the left mouse button, the mouse pointer  is changed from ![ZoomingChart5](../../images/img7227.gif) to ![ZoomingChart6](../../images/img7228.jpeg). Then, drag the mouse pointer to rotate the chart.
* **Use rotation gestures  on a touchscreen device.**
	
	Touch a 3D chart's area with two fingers and move them in a clockwise or  counterclockwise direction.
