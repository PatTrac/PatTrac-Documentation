# Preview Data
The [Dashboard Data Source Wizard](pass-query-parameters.md) and [Query Builder](query-builder.md) allow you to preview data returned after a query/[stored procedure](stored-procedures.md) execution. To do this, click the **Preview...** button.

This invokes the **Data Preview** window containing data returned after you execute the current query.
