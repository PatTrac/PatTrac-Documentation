# Create Groups
This page allows you to group data in your report. If you don't need to group your data, simply click **Next** on this page to skip this step.

Nested grouping and grouping against multiple fields are fully supported. The following image illustrates all basic grouping types.

The list on the left-hand side displays data fields that can be used to group data. To apply grouping, select columns and click the right arrow (**&gt;**) button.

Note that grouping fields on the right-hand side can be selected by clicking them. This is useful if you need to remove them or change their order. To accomplish the latter, use the up arrow (**&#8743;**) and down arrow (**&#8744;**) buttons.

You can stop the wizard on this step by clicking **Finish**. If you want to customize your report further, click **Next**. If data grouping has been applied on this page, you'll proceed to the [Choose Summary Options](choose-summary-options.md) page. If you haven't grouped your data, skip the Summaries step and go to the [Choose a Report Layout](choose-a-report-layout.md) page.
