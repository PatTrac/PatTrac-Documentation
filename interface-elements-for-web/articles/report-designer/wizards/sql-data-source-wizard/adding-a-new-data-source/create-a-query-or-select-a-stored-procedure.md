# Create a Query or Select a Stored Procedure
On this wizard page, you can choose which tables, views and/or stored procedures from your data source to display in the report.

![web-designer-report-wizard-02-select-queries-custom-query-context-menu](../../../../../images/img125841.png)

When you are required to shape the query data at the level of a data source, you can create custom queries by expanding the **Queries** category and clicking the ![web-designer-report-wizard-button-query-add](../../../../../images/img125709.png) button.
* If custom SQL editing is disabled by your software provider, clicking this button will invoke the [Query Builder](../../../interface-elements/query-builder.md) where you can create complex queries by joining multiple tables, filtering, sorting and grouping their data, as well as calculating various aggregate functions.
* If custom SQL editing is enabled by your software provider, clicking this button will invoke a context menu where you can choose whether to run the [Query Builder](../../../interface-elements/query-builder.md) or [Custom SQL Editor](../../../interface-elements/custom-sql-editor.md).

To customize an existing query using the Query Builder, click the ![web-designer-report-wizard-button-query-edit](../../../../../images/img125710.png) button on this wizard page.

To delete a query, click the ![web-designer-report-wizard-button-query-delete](../../../../../images/img125711.png) button.

You can stop the wizard at this step by clicking **Finish**.

To continue report customization, select at least one item and click **Next** to proceed to the next wizard page.
* If any custom queries and/or parameterized stored procedures are selected on this wizard page, you will be asked to customize parameters on the next wizard page: [Configure Query Parameters](configure-query-parameters.md).
* If two or more tables and/or views are selected on this wizard page (and no custom queries), you will be asked to specify the data relationships on the next wizard page: [Configure Master-Detail Relationships](configure-master-detail-relationships.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When invoking the SQL Data Source Wizard to edit an existing data source, [another version](../editing-an-existing-data-source/create-a-query-or-select-a-stored-procedure.md) of this page is displayed.

> This version is also shown if your software vendor switched the SQL Data Source Wizard to single-query mode.
