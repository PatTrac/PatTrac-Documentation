# Create a Table of Contents
This topic describes how to provide a report with a table of contents that displays page numbers for bookmarked report elements at different nesting levels, and thus makes it possible to quickly navigate to a specific document page by clicking the corresponding entry.

To demonstrate this feature, use a report with specified bookmarks similar to the one created in the following tutorial: [Create a Document Map with Bookmarks](create-a-document-map-with-bookmarks.md).

To create a table of contents in a report, do the following.
1. Drop the [Table of Contents](../../report-elements/report-controls.md) control from the [Toolbox](../../interface-elements/toolbox.md) onto the [Report Header Band](../../report-elements/report-bands.md). If the report does not contain this band, it will be created automatically.

2. Double-click the title of the table of contents and specify its text.

3. To customize title appearance, switch to the [Properties Panel](../../interface-elements/properties-panel.md), expand the **Behavior** category and use the **Level Title** option's settings.

4. To customize the appearance of all other levels, use the **Level Default** option's settings in the **Behavior** category.

5. To customize a specific level individually, add a corresponding item to the **Levels** collection of the table of contents. After adding a new level, you can access and customize its properties.

The table of contents is now ready. Switch your report to the [Preview](../../document-preview.md) mode and view the result.
