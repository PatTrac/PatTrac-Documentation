# Sorting Page
Select a column from the "Columns to Sort" list to sort grid data against this column in ascending order. The grid can be sorted more than by one column, and a list of the sorted columns is displayed at the top of the **Sorting** page.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-drag](../../../images/img128887.png) to drag the columns in this list and change the sorting priority.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-order](../../../images/img128888.png) to reverse a column's current sort order.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-delete](../../../images/img128889.png) to remove a column from the sorting list.
