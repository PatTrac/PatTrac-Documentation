# Sort Grid Rows
* To sort data, click a column header. If sorting against this column hasn't been applied, a header click will apply sorting in ascending order. If sorting has already been applied, subsequent clicks reverse the current sort order.

* A click on a column header clears the sort settings on any other columns. To sort against multiple columns, hold the SHIFT key down while clicking.
* To clear a column's sorting, click its header while pressing the CTRL key.
