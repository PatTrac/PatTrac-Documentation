	To select only one character, click before the character, hold down the **Shift** key and click the **Right Arrow** once.
* Selecting **one word**
	
	To select one word in a document, place the cursor anywhere in the word (or just before it) and **double-click** with the left mouse button. Another method is to place your cursor at the beginning of the word, hold down the **Shift** and **Ctrl** keys, and click the **Right Arrow**.
* Selecting **one paragraph**
	
	Place the cursor in the left margin and **click twice** to highlight the whole paragraph.
