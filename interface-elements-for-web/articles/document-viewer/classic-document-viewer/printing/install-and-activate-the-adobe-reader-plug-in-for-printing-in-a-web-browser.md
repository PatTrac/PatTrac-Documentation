# Install and Activate the Adobe Reader Plug-In for Printing in a Web Browser
To download and install the **Adobe Reader&#174;** plug-in, use the following link: [http://get.adobe.com/reader/](http://get.adobe.com/reader/). No software other than the **Adobe Reader&#174;** should be installed on a machine for printing purposes. After finishing the installation, the plug-in should automatically be enabled in appropriate web browsers. To learn how to manually setup your browser to use this plug-in, refer to the [Display PDF in browser](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/display-pdf-in-browser.html) document. For the changes to take effect, you may need to close and reopen the browser.

Note that many modern web browsers include their own PDF plug-ins, which automatically replace the **Adobe Reader&#174;** plug-in. If you need to revert to the **Adobe** plug-in, refer to the [Configure browser to use the Adobe PDF plug-in](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/pdf-browser-plugin-configuration.html) document.

For more information on printing report documents using this plug-in, see [Print a Report Using the PDF Web Browser Plug-In](print-a-report-using-the-pdf-web-browser-plug-in.md).
