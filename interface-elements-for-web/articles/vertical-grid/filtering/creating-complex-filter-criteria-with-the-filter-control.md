# Creating Complex Filter Criteria with the Filter Control
To build complex filter criteria with an unlimited number of filter conditions combined by logical operators, use the built-in **Filter Control**.

To open the **Filter Control**, click the filter image displayed within the filter bar or the filter expression link.
