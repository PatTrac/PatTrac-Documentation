# Report Designer
This section of the  documentation describes the basic principles of creating reports with **Web Report Designer**.

The Web Report Designer allows you to create new reports from scratch, bind them to data, display a report's Print Preview and send its output to a printer or export it to a file on a disk.

* a JavaScript/HTML5 engine that provides a responsive user interface for in-browser reporting on the client;
* an integrated Property Grid, a Quick Access panel for editing commonly used options, a Data Explorer and Parameters panels;
* a rich set of report controls (see the [Toolbox](report-designer/interface-elements/toolbox.md) document for a complete list of available controls);
* cross-browser compatibility.
